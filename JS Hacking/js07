here onload a function is called password():
    <script language="JavaScript" type="6fdcc0175c7eee952dff980b-text/javascript">

    function password () {

        var s1, a2, v3, e4, input;

        s1=window.document.bgColor; // #D0D0D0

        a2=window.document.linkColor; // #FF9900

        v3=s1.substring (6,9)+a2.substring (2,8); // 0F9900
        e4=v3.toUpperCase ();


        
        input=prompt("Password:","");

        if (input!=v3 && input!=e4) {

        alert("Wrong!");

        window.location.href="../index.php";

        }

        else {

        window.location.href=v3+".php";

        }

    }

but here the var v3 and e4 were to far means they had many spaces before them so it was quiet hard to not
find them but here i found them

so finding s1 and a2 in the source code and calculating v3 i got scored
