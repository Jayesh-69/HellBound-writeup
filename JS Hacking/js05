going to sources and level5.js we get this :
    a = prompt("Please enter password!","");
    date = new Date();
    b = date.getFullYear();
    if(a == b){
    alert("Good job! You got it!");
    window.location.href=b+".php";
    }
    else
    {
    alert("Try it again!");

    }
analyzing we get b=2021 so on entering password as 2021 we redirected to 2021.php but we get
file not found
so i entered 2020.php in url and get scored
