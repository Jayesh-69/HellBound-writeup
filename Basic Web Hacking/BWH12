Find the password for the protected folder and then access it!

so in the parameter it says ?page=challenge.php so i changed it to 
protected/.htaccess and got
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Area"
    AuthUserFile ".htpasswd"
    require valid-user

so i went to .htpasswd and got
    user:1Gwn39lwmRu9U

actually it is hashed using john the ripper and word list as dictionary got the password
