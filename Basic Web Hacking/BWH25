Drake's school employed some new tech guys to help block "bad" websites such as www.hellboundhackers.org.
He told me that his friend coded up something in cURL to get the page and display it, 
he also mentioned that it uses numbers to bypass the site

googling about url obscure we see that a site can also we called using number ex:
    http://www.pc-help.org/obscure.htm.
    http://3468664375@3468664375/o%62s%63ur%65%2e%68t%6D
above both are same

go to this site and read it and do the procedure to get the decimal of the ip address of
hellboundhackers

first find ip using nslookup convert the ip to decimal and paste it and get site
