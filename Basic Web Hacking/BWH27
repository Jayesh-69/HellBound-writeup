IceBreaker decided to write his very own clean() function for PHP. He has opened it up to anyone for 
penetration testing.
Your goal is to display the text <script>alert(1)</script> simulating a XSS injection.

so when i wrote <script>alert(1)</script> this i got alert(1)

so i wrote <scr</script>ipt>alert(1)</sc</script>ript> then i got <scr<>ipt>alert(1)</sc</>ript>

so now t wrote this and got score
<scrscriptipt>alert(1)</scscriptript>
