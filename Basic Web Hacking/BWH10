The following page can only be seen if your IP range is the one that is allowed. 
This .htaccess stuff is complicated.

if we go to the page and see the source we see that 
<!-- range is around 200 to 230 and 23 to 91 -->

so we probably need to spoof our ip address

so i used foxyproxy to set my ip address to the ip in range 
i found free proxy list on google
