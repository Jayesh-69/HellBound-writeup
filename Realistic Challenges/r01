Your goal for this mission is to log in as an registered user (johndoe/password) and analyze the site 
to gain administrator rights to change the price of the program to make it a lot more cheaper.

first seeing the page source we see a image in /images/one.jpg
so i went to /images and found JohnDoe.txt and administrator.txt going to JohnDoe.txt we get

    JohnDoe
    password = password:5d2e19393cc5ef67 
    Network analysis

    sessionid: 4601597

and in administrator.txt we have

    administrator
    password = password:60c033095644bd16 

    status:administrator

    AuthID: 4601420

so now to go toys.php and change the authid as administrator and change the price to 1
