My Friend heard that HellBound Hackers Backup Generator's Admin that the had made a backup and they 
were stored in a directory called bacups/ or backups/ and that the backup file is named in this order 
year, month, day, hour, .sql with no minutes and he also heard that the backup was made on September of 
2004. It looks like backup_2004-09-01_1000.sql

here it says it look like so the name of file could be backup_2004-09-(01-30)_(00-23)00.sql

so i created a for_r02.py where we go through each url and check for response 200
https://www.hellboundhackers.org/challenges/real2/backups/backup_2004-09-04_1900.sql

going to this we get admin:and password md5 hash decrypt it we get
password = status

so logging in we get score
