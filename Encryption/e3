seeing it it doesnt make any sense but we can get that here "l" is "i"
and "q" is "t"

so it has a diffrence of 2
but hint says addition and subtraction so the above twi were subtraction and its alternate

so first -2 then +2 and we get

"when it began i was confused i want to hear who cracked that"
